But if you are a traveller knowing few things i have experience will make your journey much nicer :). 1) If you arrive in&nbsp;Beauvais airport and you need to find a way to go to Paris city center you can get Bus tickets from here.

      "John Carpenter (born c. 1968)[1] became the first millionaire on the United States version of the game show Who Wants to Be a Millionaire on November 19, 1999" [1]. The most important part of the show is the last question where he attempted to claim the final prize. Watch the following video which is too good for being a contestant at his final question for 1 million dollars. [1] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Carpenter_(game_show_contestant)

      I have been struggling lately to find good resources to compile and change OpenJDK. There is a problem with Mac OS Yosemite as it uses Clang as the compiler. But Open JDK 9 builds without a problem. I am adding useful resources here just incase someone finds it useful. How to build it 1)&nbsp;hg clone http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk9/jdk9 jdk9 2) cd ./jdk9 3)&nbsp;bash ./get_source.sh (This will take sometime to download the sources so be patient.

      Have you ever lost your mobile phone in your life? I have lost twice and yes it is not a great position to be. But these two incidents had two different implications. When i lost my first phone it was a nokia phone (N71 to be exact) which was quite a smart phone at that time around 2007. Yes i wanted to find the phone but could not the story was over and life went on.

      &nbsp;When should i give up something? &nbsp;So you should never give up something until you find something you really want. Yes... Until you find it.. :). We usually draw the give up line on what society believe, Not what we really believe. We often create boundaries on what society believes achievable. Until someone who really believe him or herself step in expand the limits. We never thought someone could fly until wright brothers flew, We never imagined a world speaking with someone thousand of miles away until Alexander Graham Bell invented the first practical telephone.

      &nbsp;In the previous post i discussed about the importance of developing a most important gift a human has inside his brain.... the memory. In this world we have externalized most of the important stuff to external digital world. In a way it has made things evolving faster. We are gathering much more knowledge than earlier. Wait.. Is it knowledge or knowledge pointers? The most suitable word is knowledge pointers using which we can retrieve knowledge easily.

      &nbsp;If you need any information you just type Google. Simple is n't it? So do we have to bother about memorizing anything this world? Is there a pay back for what you memorize? Can we rely on internet and only just learn how to search and can we be successful? &nbsp;I am sure most of the people have forgotten the importance of memorizing things in this information age. But the people who master memorizing things excel more often than people who do not.

      &nbsp;Do you think learning math and science is something alien from outer universe ? Do you struggle to solve complex mathematics or science problems? If you keep on adding questions there will be a lot to add on. Because even i have some of those problems in my mind. I excelled in college and was able to get into the top engineering University in Sri Lanka. At present i am reading for my Masters Degree in Distributed computing in Europe which involve Science and Mathematics heavily.
